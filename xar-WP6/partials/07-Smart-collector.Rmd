      ]   


### Main Goal:

- To have an open source IoT in order to deploy for the demonstrator

## Technical development of smart collector to collect plastic waste

.pull-left-1[


**Tasks in DOA:**

- Task 6.4 3D printing of recycled plastic demonstrator

**What is our target :**

- To be able to print recycled printed parts for personalized furniture from usable plastic waste collected locally.

**What we have Done so far:**

- .bg-yellow[Create a V1.1 of the collector.]
- Printability test for fused granular Fabrication

**What are the next steps:**

- .bg-yellow[Create a dashboard for smart collectors]
- Printability test from recycled PLA
