## Main techno Devs ! 

.pull-left-1[


**Tasks in DOA:**

- Task 6.4 3D printing of recycled plastic demonstrator

**What is our target :**

- To be able to print recycled printed parts for personalized furniture from usable plastic waste collected locally.

**What we have Done so far:**

- Create a V1.1 of the collector.
- .bg-yellow[Printability test for fused granular Fabrication]

**What are the next steps:**

- Create a dashboard for smart collectors
- .bg-yellow[Printability test from recycled PLA]

## Printability test on Virgin material for calibration purposes

.pull-left[

Working test for March – September 2021

- Realization of first test using virgin material (e.g. PLA) for printability purposes and calibration tests with regarding to the commercial machines.
- Evaluate the limit conditions of the open hardware machine using Design of Experiments (DoE) approach.
- Fabrication of printing samples to evaluate the quality  considering the INEDIT project conditions.
- Documentation of the test as scientific rapport defining the machine, protocol, user experience and the implications for DRAM.
