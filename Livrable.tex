\section{Plastic Issues for the European
Union}\label{plastic-issues-for-the-european-union}}

Since 1950', our society have gained enormous advantages in terms of
quality of life thanks to the technical development of the development
of plastic and polymer materials. Plastic is a material that is widely
used in our daily lives and plays a fundamental role in industry and
economic development. The plastic material are found in almost all our
products: food packaging, cars, technological tools, clothing, among
others. The main reason is that plastic materials offer a variety of
chemical and mechanical properties to be useful for a wide array of
applications. Plastics are extremely useful, but their mismanagement has
affected the environment and our health. The over-consumption and
especially bad practices (single use, difficulty of reuse, etc.), make
plastics one of the major societal challenges of an ecological
transition that has become imperative. The main problem is the
end-of-life treatment which traditionally uses a centralized system
where plastic waste often has to travel thousands of kilometers\ldots{}
to be incinerated or landfilled. In addition to the energy and
environmental impact of their production, there is also the impact of
the end of life.

Unfortunately, the plastic waste pollution poses a major threat because
of the issue of non-degradability affecting the ecological environments
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hopewell2009}{Hopewell et al., 2009};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ryberg2019}{Ryberg et al., 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Thompson2009b}{Thompson et al., 2009}). Indeed,
recycling rates remain small (approx. 14\%) in the plastic packaging
field on a global scale
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hahladakis2018}{Hahladakis and Iacovidou,
2018}). Even in Europe, which tends to lead on environmental
stewardship, the recycling rate is about 32.5 wt\%
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Plastics2019}{Plastics, 2019}). However, these
values consider the amount of plastic waste collected, rather than the
total amount in circulation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kranzinger2018}{Kranzinger et al., 2018}).
Rethinking the development and use of plastics is central to the
circular economy paradigm, to provide less harmful options for the
environment. Thus, more types of plastic packaging are available, but
each reflects diverse circular economy strategies

To tackle this accumulation waste problem, the European strategy for
plastics in the circular economy (CE) is gaining attention in the policy
and business debate surrounding sustainable development of industrial
production (\protect\hyperlink{ref-EC2018}{European Commission, 2018};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Geissdoerfer2017}{Geissdoerfer et al., 2017}). CE
tackles a central societal issue concerning the current principle
``take, make, dispose'' (linear economy) and its negative effects caused
by the depletion of natural resources, waste generation, biodiversity
loss, pollution (water, air, soil) and non-sustainable economics
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-VanBuren2016}{van Buren et al., 2016}). The
validation (technical, economic, legislative) of waste plastic as a
secondary raw material in industrial processes is considered now a core
target to integrate CE into the plastic value chain
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Simon2019}{Simon, 2019}). Strategies of open and
closed-loop recycling as well as upcycling and downcycling functionality
approaches can offer paths to validate the secondary raw materials
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Zhuo2014}{Zhuo and Levendis, 2014}). The
promotion of cross-sectorial valorization of plastic wastes through
Industrial symbiosis approaches seems to be a relevant strategy for the
circular economy strategies of the EU
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Karaylan2021}{Karayılan et al., 2021})

\subsection{Presentation of the scale of the demostrator: Rives de
Meurthe district (Nancy,
France)}\label{presentation-of-the-scale-of-the-demostrator-rives-de-meurthe-district-nancy-france}}

The demonstrator is placed at the City of Nancy - France. Nancy is a
city located in northeastern France, in the region of Lorraine. It is
the capital of the Meurthe-et-Moselle department and has a population of
approximately 105,000 inhabitants.

It is the capital of the Meurthe-et-Moselle department, on the Meurthe
River in Lorraine. Nancy was the capital of the steel industry until its
collapse. In 1977, it created France's third largest technology park,
Nancy-Brabois, which is very accessible thanks to the highway network.

Located in the east of the city, the Rives de Meurthe district extends
from the banks of the Meurthe in the east to the boulevard Lobau and the
boulevard of the 26th infantry regiment in the west. To the south, it is
bounded by the rue de Tomblaine and to the north by the rue du Crosne.
It is separated from the rest of the city of Nancy by the canal from the
Marne to the Rhine. It thus gives the impression of being an independent
city, adjacent to Nancy.

\hypertarget{third-place-octroi-nancy}{%
\subsection{Third place Octroi Nancy}\label{third-place-octroi-nancy}}

The third place Octroi Nancy is a part of the neighborhood of the Rives
de Meurthe. This project transforms the former slaughterhouses of the
city of Nancy into \emph{``cultural, creative and citizen''} third place
with \(4600~m^2\) of renovated buildings
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-pallot2021}{Pallot et al., 2021}). Four large
buildings (Figure~\ref{fig-ok}) were adequated to provide a friendly and
multidisciplinary meeting place between culture and innovation; open to
experimentation and intended to operate as a creative laboratory for the
city. This place is intended to be an open space allowing the connection
of future occupants, such as artists and creatives, with the inhabitants
of the city and companies.

The \textbf{Lorraine Smart Cities Living Lab (LSCLL)} is a
trans-disciplinary resource center of the Université de Lorraine, to
support and link the different societal challenges of the Lorraine
territory with the local resources. It enables the integration of
different users, implementing collaborative and agile approaches in the
service of \emph{Research, Development of Innovations, Training and a
Citizen Culture}. It experiments in terms of projects, governance and
support platform since 2008, involving several laboratories and other
public and private partners as detailed in the Figure~\ref{fig-LSCLL}.
Since 2010, this project is member of the European Network of Living
Labs (ENoLL)\footnote{\(4^{th}\) wave of labelisation)}, seeking to
develop public-private-population Partnerships (PPPPs) to disseminate
innovation and related practices.

Since 2014, the LSCLL formalizes its strategic intention with the the
Lorraine Fab Living Lab\textregistered    (LF2L\textregistered) research
platform for prospective assessment of innovative usages
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Dupont2016}{Dupont et al., 2016}).\\
The LF2L physical environment is constituted by a collaborative and a
fabLab space. The collaborative space allows users to foster
co-operation in engineering design with different stakeholders in order
to new create concepts/designs. On the other hand, FabLab space allows
users to materialize the concepts/designs in an easy and quick way in
order to have an prospective evaluation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Boujut2003}{Boujut and Blanco, 2003};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Dupont2015b}{Dupont et al., 2015},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Dupont2014}{2014}). The synergy of these two
spaces enables the project development in a living lab approach taking
into account the User Centered Design principles.

The conceptual framework is composed of three main elements as
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-lf2l-methodology}:

The conceptual innovation framework of LF2L takes into consideration the
2D (concept), 3D (object), 4D (over time) approaches involving different
type of stakeholders (e.g.~researches, companies, networks,) in order to
have a foresight usage evaluation of a new concept, technology or
project. The stages and 2D/3D/4D resources allowing prospective
assessment of innovative usages in order to support this conceptual
framework inside this ``innovation space'' as indicated in figure 2.3
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Dupont2016}{Dupont et al., 2016},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Dupont2015b}{2015}): This approach is useful to
accelerate the deployment of industrial and/or urban demonstrators.

\subsection{Rationale for the technological system of the 3D printing
recycling
demonstrator}\label{rationale-for-the-technological-system-of-the-3d-printing-recycling-demonstrator}}

Based on the context characteristics of the (LF2L\textregistered) and
the Octroi local ecosystems, the 3D printed demonstrator, also called
locally as the ``Green Fablab'', it is an initial socio-technical
demonstrator of the distributed recycling approach that combines a
living lab approach inside a citizen third place ecosystem.

The Green FabLab demonstrator aims to experiment the technical
feasibility evaluation of a distributed and local plastic recycling for
3D printing technology in the context of these open innovation spaces
such as fab labs, Hackerspaces or even industrial prototyping zones. In
these geographically distributed spaces, the polymer recycling process
of the surrounding areas (streets, neighbourhood, industrial zones) will
be carried out at small lot sizes minimizing, energy consumptions, and
carbon emissions compared to the tradition centralized systems, as some
researches have already explored this path.

The main purpose of this demonstrator in the INEDIT project is to
understand the conditions under which to deploy a notion of circular
economy with the feedstock of the open source 3D printers and manual
desktop injection. The outputs are, not only by minimizing use of the
environment as a sink for residuals but -- perhaps more importantly --
by minimizing the use of virgin materials. Hence, the environmental
impact of this technology is significantly reduced. Moreover, taking
into account the exponential growth of these spaces (Fablab, Hakerspace,
Makespace), they could help to increase the efficiency to the problem of
polymer recycling through the development of a distributed recycling
approach.

\textbf{The Green FabLab project aims to demonstrate that plastic waste
material can have several uses, and therefore several values, during its
life cycle}. The same material could be recycled and transformed into
new raw material for different products. It is in this spirit that many
associations, SMEs, local authorities and individuals are developing new
local recycling practices that could allow us to aim for an economy that
is more respectful of the environment, fairer for society and more
engaging for local politicians.

The Additive manufacturing (AM) -also known as 3D printing- is an
important industrial vector in the and its direct (and distributed)
manufacturing capabilities is becoming a key industrial process that
could play a relevant role in the transition from a linear to circular
economy (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Despeisse2016}{Despeisse et al., 2017}).
AM technologies is expected to transform the production process
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chen2017}{Chen et al., 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jiang2017}{Jiang et al., 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rahman2018}{Rahman et al., 2018}) thanks to its
ability to transform a numerical model into a deposition of material
(points, lines or areas) to create a 3D part
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bourell2017}{Bourell et al., 2017}). The
expiration of the first patents has contributed to an increased
interest, creating consumer value and potential for disruption
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Beltagui2020}{Beltagui et al., 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-West2016a}{West and Kuk, 2016}). In economic
terms, the global additive manufacturing market is expected to reach USD
23.33 billion by 2026 (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ReportsAndData2019}{Data,
2019}). However, determining when and how to take advantage of the
benefits is a challenge for traditional means of production. From a
societal viewpoint, Jiang et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jiang2017}{2017}) reported that the product
development could change from traditional stage-gate models to
iterative, agile processes changing the scenario by 2030.

The technical development of INEDIT's demonstrator is based on the
distributed recycling via additive manufacturing (DRAM) approach
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-CruzSanchez2020}{Cruz Sanchez et al., 2020}).
This approach is a major scientific output from the INEDIT project as a
proposition of the future industrial landscape.

DRAM is defined as the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical
recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. In the literature,
DRAM approach emphasizes the technical steps required to reuse plastic
waste through the recycling chains for material-extrusion-based 3D
printing (\protect\hyperlink{ref-CruzSanchez2020}{Cruz Sanchez et al.,
2020}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-Little2020}{Little et al., 2020}). The use
of recycled material, either in the form of raw material or blended with
virgin material, is a method of special interest to contribute to
sustainable manufacturing (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Zhao2018}{Zhao et al.,
2018}).

Figure~\ref{fig-dram} illustrates the conceptual model of DRAM.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,height=\textheight]{figures/DRAM-10.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-dram}DRAM}

\end{figure}

In a general overview, the \textbf{Recovery (I)} phase concerns the
logistic operations to consider to collect the plastic wastes to be
reused in DRAM. The \textbf{Preparation (II)} phase corresponds to the
actions and strategies to identify, separate, sort, size reduce and
clean waste plastic to guarantee adequate quality for DRAM. The
\textbf{Compounding (III)} phase refers to the development of mono- and
composite-materials. The \textbf{Feedstock (IV)} phase identifies the
actions to fabricate the material usable for the printing process,
either filament for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) or the particle
size for Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF). The \textbf{Printing (V)}
stage identifies applications and process improvements for the recycled
printed part. The \textbf{Quality (VI)} phase identifies the multi-level
technical characterization performed to the recycled material.

In the DRAM methodology, consumers have an economic incentive to
recycle. This is because they can use their waste as feedstock for a
wide range of consumer products that can be produced for a fraction of
the conventional cost of the equivalent products. Moreover, 3D printing
is especially well suited because it enables the production of parts
with (almost) no waste, and could reduce the waste related to the
material by more than 40 \%, reusing 95\% of the unused material
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Petrovic2011}{Petrovic et al., 2011}).
Currently, most of the cost of 3D printing is associated with filament
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wittbrodt2013}{Wittbrodt et al., 2013}). By
recycling raw materials such as Polylactic acid (PLA), one of the most
frequently used materials in 3D printing, it is possible to reduce the
carbon dioxide emissions that are incurred by transport to landfills or
shipping to customers, offering environmental benefits
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Santander2020}{Santander et al., 2020}).

A large number of products can already be manufactured with AM, which
affects the geographical spread and density of global value chains
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Laplume2016}{Laplume et al., 2016}). It is
expected that the reach of AM printable products will be much greater in
the future, as the production of multi-material and built-in
functionalities (e.g.~electronics) will be possible to a large extent.
In addition, the production of spare parts can be carried out on-site,
modifying the role of suppliers in the production lines
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Zanoni2019}{Zanoni et al., 2019}). Matt et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Matt2015}{2015}) explored the stages of
distributed model factories and decentralized production types ranging
from distributed capabilities to cloud production. Thus, the need of
transport will be much more carefully because the fact that AM will
enable decentralization of production to localities near customers or in
the most extreme distributed scenario at the customer's premises
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-BonninRoca2019}{Bonnín Roca et al., 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Petersen2017a}{Petersen and Pearce, 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wittbrodt2013}{Wittbrodt et al., 2013}).
Moreover, AM technology makes it possible to reduce market entry
barriers, reduce capital requirements and achieve an efficient minimum
scale of production to promote distributed, flexible forms of production
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Despeisse2016}{Despeisse et al., 2017}).

This enables an alternative option from an economy-of-scale to an
economy-of-scope, where the products are highly personalized satisfying
niche communities or even individuals
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hienerth2014}{Hienerth et al., 2014};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Petrick2014}{\textbf{Petrick2014?}}). For these
reasons, the AM technology could be a driver for a shift in
manufacturing from globally distributed production to local facilities.
Significant efforts are being made by industry and the scientific
community to move AM techniques from rapid prototyping and tooling
stages towards direct digital manufacturing (DDM)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mueller2012}{Gibson et al., 2010};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Holmstrom2016}{Holmström et al., 2016}), with the
concomitant environmental and social benefits. Nevertheless, Niaki et
al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Niaki2019}{2019}) demonstrated that
environmental and social benefits are not the key preferential factors
in the adoption of AM technologies in different industrial sectors. Only
the economic factor remains relevant in the AM implementation,
considering time- and cost-saving as the most important reasons.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis of UL case for deployment in

The implementation of the Green Fablab needs to be done considering
certain assumptions and simplifications to reduce the complexity of this
socio-technical system. The following assumptions were assumed in terms
of geographical scale, material recollection and manufacturing aspects:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  From a material perspective, only certain types of plastic wastes are
  considered. Specifically, Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), High
  density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polypropylene (PP) and Polylactic Acid
  (PLA). The major reason is from the technical perspective relies on
  the availability of these materials at the local area around the
  physical demonstrator.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    PLA is one of the most used plastics in 3D printing. As plastic
    waste sources, PLA waste from clean sources like printed prototypes
    or 3D printed parts scard has been considered.
  \item
    HDPE is one of ???
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The recycling system considers the sorting, separation and cleaning
  process as a high because the collected material corresponds to a
  non-contaminated waste. For example, discarded 3D printing parts used
  for prototyping.
\item
  From a geographical point of view, only plastic waste collected from
  the smart collectors was considered. Nevertheless, as MVP use case
  demonstrator, this model can be extrapolated to schools and high
  schools in the Lorraine region (France) have been considered, and the
  route of recovery and delivery considered is obtained in the work of
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Santander2020}{Santander et al., 2020}).
\end{itemize}

The 3D printing activities carried out in these establishments have a
specific purpose of making product prototypes and mock-ups, which allow
to generate testing activities, design evaluations, functional
evaluations, corrections. Therefore, after a short lifetime, 3D printing
can be a source of significant amounts of plastic waste due to printed
parts that do not possess the desired quality, unused raw materials, or
products that have already fulfilled their life cycle
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Alexandre2020}{\textbf{Alexandre2020?}})

\hypertarget{recovery-i}{%
\subsubsection{Recovery I}\label{recovery-i}}

The first step in the implementation of the Green Fablab OMDF is the
activity of \emph{Recovery I}. This phase aims to establish a minimal
baseline logistic operations to consider to collect the plastic wastes
to be recycled in the process. In the scientific literature, the
recovery is one of the main activities to considered in the recycling
process given that this structures a supply chain that certainly is
variable (i.e.~in function of the public support to sort the material in
the specific points of collection). This process is the first step to
create a closed-loop supply network approach for the distributed
manufacturing (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Santander2020}{Santander et al.,
2020}).

The collection tasks consists of collecting plastic waste at different
established points, which are then transported to a treatment center
where it is recycled. The collection and recycling process aims to
generate a recycling micro-network at the local level (neighborhood
scale), which allows the recovery and revaluation of plastic waste
through 3D printing. This allows to save impacts related to the
traditional treatment of plastic waste, as well as to increase the
recycling capacity in the city, giving more independence over the
recycling process. Figure~\ref{fig-recovery} illustrates the process
model considered.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{figures/Recovery.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-recovery}Recovery processus of the Green Fablab}

\end{figure}

The main difficult relies in the pertinent identification and the
quality state of the plastic waste. Therefore, in the framework of the
INEDIT project, the UL case demonstrator developed a ``smart collector
prototype'' as illustrated in the Figure~\ref{fig-smart-collector}. The
complete documentation of the technical device can be found in the
following open access reference
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gabriel2023}{Gabriel and Cruz, 2023}). Given the
possible implementation in other contexts, the source files are shared
in open-source repository with the purpose that open communities to take
advantage the experiences developed at the Université de Lorraine.
Eventually, the open communities can propose improvements and better
versions.

\end{figure}

This is a relevant strategy given the cross-line of Industry 4.0 and
circular economy, which is opening up fields such as smart waste
management systems options to improve the effectiveness of different
materials, including plastic waste
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ranjbari2021}{Ranjbari et al., 2021}) using
information technology tools with the advent of the Internet of Things
(IoT) Rejeb et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-rejeb2022}{2022}). Smart
waste management system (SWMS) consists of public garbage collectors
with embedded technology that is used to monitor real-time level of
garbage bins in public places (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bano2020}{Bano et
al., 2020}). The interest of this system is to optimize the path for the
garbage collecting van that eventually reduces fuel cost. However, this
work is mainly based on simulation. Therefore, there is an avenue to
simplify experimentation in this domain using common open-source
technology (hardware and software)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Pearce2009}{Pearce and Mushtaq, 2009}) to
implement projects that require heavy infrastructure such as routers and
a gateway to deploy in the territory.

The main functional requirement of the smart collector is to collect and
provide data about plastic waste production in order to design a local
and distributed recycling chain of value. However, the smart collector
may be used in various use cases such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Monitoring the quantity of any other product that is collected over a
  large area.\\
\item
  Generating data about behavior to more precisely dimensions public
  infrastructure.\\
\item
  Monitoring the transformation and recycling process inside the
  transformation unit to follow the state and quantity of raw material
  and final product.\\
\item
  Initiating a digitization process in the waste management process as
  the information system element present here is flexible and commonly
  used in various types of projects.
\end{itemize}

The device uses a controller compatible with batteries and use WAN
technology to avoid the deployment of routers for data acquisition.
Although using various types of sensors allows us to achieve better
results (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Catania2014}{Catania and Ventura, 2014})
by crossing data, the main indicator remains the weight.

The process illustrated by the Figure~\ref{fig-abstract} can be
described in the as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Smart Collector installation}: The first step is to identify
  the main actors in the neighborhood through meetings, visits and
  interviews in order to propose integration into the recycling network
  by installing a smart collector on their premises.
\item
  \textbf{Supervision}: The monitoring is done through a dashboard that
  provides direct information sent by the smart collector. This allows
  to know the weight of each installed smart collector, allowing to have
  an approximation of its degree of occupancy.
\item
  \textbf{Receiving and storing plastic waste}: The storage area must be
  organized and functional with respect to the needs of the
  demonstrator.
\item
  \textbf{Plan and execute the collection}:
\end{enumerate}

In the scientific literature, the reverse logistic and closed loop
supply chains have been extensively studied in the scientific
literature. For instance,
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Santander2021}{\textbf{Santander2021?}})
evaluated the benefits of a near loop and closed loop recycling network
focused on additive manufacturing, mainly producing recycled filament.
The main results show an economic and environmental benefit of sourcing
filament from recycled plastic rather than purchasing exported virgin
filament.

\hypertarget{preparation-ii}{%
\subsubsection{Preparation II}\label{preparation-ii}}

The second phase of the corresponds to the actions and processes to
identify, separate, sort, size reduce and clean waste plastic to
guarantee with the purpose to obtain feedstock material that is adequate
for the distributed recycling process.

The plastic waste preparation process aims to conditioned the collected
plastic to the requirements of 3D printing. For this process 3 main
sub-processes are considered:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Identification and Sorting}: These two processes aim to
  identify the type of plastic given the regular standard for the
  polymer industry. The process of identification and separation of
  plastics is done manually and allows to separate the plastics that can
  be used as raw material for further production processes.
\item
  \textbf{Cleaning}: This process is aims to remove the traces of any
  other substance that may be present in the plastic waste. In this way
  the processing machines will not be exposed to possible anomalies
  linked to material impurities.
\item
  \textbf{Size reduction}: The size reduction process is carried out to
  possible obtain an adequate granulometry. This process allows to adapt
  the plastic waste for the direct injection process and/or the
  extrusion process.
\item
  \textbf{Drying phase}: This step prevents the formation of bubbles in
  the recycled material when it is melted during the following extrusion
  or densification step
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Niaounakis2013}{\textbf{Niaounakis2013?}}).
  Moreover, complete elimination of water prevent hydrolytic
  decomposition of the molecular chains during the melting or
  plasticization, so that the treated material has to be as dry as
  possible.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{compounding-iii}{%
\subsubsection{Compounding III}\label{compounding-iii}}

The \emph{Compounding} phase is related to the operation, strategies in
the development of composite materials using recycled feedstock intended
to be use in a printing process. There have been several literature
reviews about the technical aspect of composite materials in the
additive manufacturing context Mohan et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mohan2017}{2017}).

Special attention has been paid on material extrusion technologies in
the production of polymer/composite feedstocks as it is economical,
environmentally advantageous and adaptable to flexible filament material
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Singh2017}{Singh et al., 2017}). For example,
Mohan et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mohan2017}{2017}) presented a
review on composite materials and process parameters optimisation for
the fused deposition modelling (FDM) process for improving the
mechanical properties (i.e.~tensile strength, fatigue). Brenken et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Brenken2017}{2018}) reported a detailed summary
of mechanical properties of printed parts for different composite
material for fused filament fabrication. Five majors strategies are
elucidated from the literature review such as:

In the context of the Green Fablab demonstrator of INEDIT project, the
focus is to study the 1) mono-recycled material and 2) the
virgin-recycled blend material. The development of recycling niches of
mono-material where the additive manufacturing can be implemented is key
to study. Different studies in laboratory conditions have been made to
show the technical feasibility of recycling. They include HDPE Kreiger
and Pearce (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kreiger2013}{2013}), Biomass-derived
poly(ethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PEF)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kucherov2017}{Kucherov et al., 2017}), PLA
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-CruzSanchez2017}{Cruz Sanchez et al., 2017}),
Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE)/ low density polyethylene
(LDPE), (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hart2018}{Hart et al., 2018}),
thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Woern2017}{Woern
and Pearce, 2017}). In fact, Hart et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hart2018}{2018}) demonstrated the reconstitution
of residual polymeric packaging waste from Meals-Ready-to-Eat (MREs)
generated by soldiers around the world into additively manufactured
appliances. One conclusion of these studies is the positive technical
use of recycled mono-material for additive manufacturing purposes.

However, it has to be highlighted that one major assumption of these
studies relies in that the material used is already sorted, cleaned and
using a same type of discarded product. For INEDIT project, the interest
is to take into account the inner variability that could be in the
recovery process, concerning the type of material given the fact, while
there are seven types of recycling symbols for each type of polymer, one
major constraint in the current systems is that each manufacturing
company have a patented use of the additive in the polymer matrix, in
order to fulfil its initial function of the product.

\hypertarget{feedstock-iv}{%
\subsubsection{Feedstock IV}\label{feedstock-iv}}

The Feedstock III phase refers to the processes in order to transform
the plastic waste into usable material material for the fabrication
stage. Two outputs are seen in this etape: 1) the filament feedstock and
2) the pellet feedstock. The use of filament or pellet material are in
coherence with the machine process used in the fabrication (cf section
4.4.5). The figure XX present the modeling of the process:

The filament and pellet production process makes it possible to produce
the necessary raw material from plastic waste. The production of these
intermediate products allows the use of different technologies related.
Before using these products (filaments and pellets) it is necessary to
carry out evaluation tests to assess the geometrical characteristics
that are necessary in the printing process.

Figure XX and table present the technical characteristics of the
material equipement

\subsubsection{Fabrication process -- Technological mix to valorize the
recycled
material}\label{fabrication-process-technological-mix-to-valorize-the-recycled-material}}

In this step, the major output is the valorisation of the plastic waste
material using different two alternative paths: 1) Desktop injection
process, and 2), 3D printing process. As matter of the validation of the
demonstrator at TRL 6 level, the ambition of the demonstrator in the
INEDIT project is to experiment and prove a technological ecosystem mix
that seeks to valorise in a distributed approach different plastics for
different purposes and stakeholders. Therefore, the initial choice is
these two paths to create objects injected and 3D printed parts that are
useful to the local ecosystem of the demonstrator. The technologies are
presented in the following paragraphs.

\hypertarget{desktop-injection-moulding}{%
\paragraph{Desktop injection

Injection mouding is one of the most used technique to form plastic
materials.

\subparagraph{3D printing process: Fused Filament \& Granular
Fabrication (FFF \&
FGF)}\label{d-printing-process-fused-filament-granular-fabrication-fff-fgf}}

In the era of the additive manufacturing technology, without a doubt,
the material extrusion-based systems such as the fused filament
fabrication (FFF) has been one of the prominent processes. In fact, the
technological development of open-source 3D printers is creating more
affordable Additive Manufacturing (AM) machines for society in different
applications. It provides the possibility of mass diffusion of this
technology, and consequently, AM is being recognised as a disruptive
that could up-end the last two centuries of approaches to design and
manufacturing Birtchnell and Urry
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Birtchnell2013a}{2013}).

In the Green Fablab demonstrator, we have two types of material-based
systems: 1) Fused filament fabrication (FFF) and 2) Fused Granular
Fabrication (FGF):

\end{figure}

The filament fabrication was developed and patented in 1989 by Scott
Crump as \emph{Fused Deposition Modelling}, and since 2009, the
technology became open source
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Crump1992}{\textbf{Crump1992?}}), known as Fused
Filament Fabrication, to establish the difference betwwen the registred
mark. A schematic representation of this technology is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-fff}. This process usually uses thermoplastic polymer
filaments that are heated until a temperature slightly higher than the
melting temperature at the nozzle of the machine, reaching a semi-liquid
state. At this point, the polymer is extruded on the platform to create
the first layer of the object and after that, the polymer continues to
be printed on top of the previous layer, so that, filament fuses with
the previous layer and then is solidified at room temperature after
printing Cruz Sanchez et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-CruzSanchez2017}{2017}).

On the other hand, the Fused Granular Fabrication is a direct extrusion
systems of pellets is a key technical advancement to facilitate the use
of recycled material in the printing process. Volpato et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Volpato2015}{2015}) describes the development of
a piston driven extrusion head that can extrude polypropylene granules
into a filament. The head was designed to minimize the volume of
material fused during the extrusion process and reduce the effect of
material degradation. Canessa et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Canessa2017}{2017}) developed a mini extruder
for pellets or granules of recycled plastic that can be used in a RepRap
FDM 3D printer for rapid prototyping. The use of Moineau pump technology
to add precise volumetric control to the extrusion of pellets opens
extraordinary new possibilities. It is important to mention that a
Moineau pump has to be coupled to a first stage Auger screw. This
ensures a continuous feed of melted plastic with-out inclusion of air
bubbles, since the Moineau pump itself cannot guarantee such condition.
However, it is also important to highlight that currently this
technology is the phase of laboratory experimentation and initial market
diffusion. The complexity

from the INEDIT platform. The starting point of this activity is the
reception of the respective documents that contains the 3D model to be
manufactured by the use case.

One of the outputs of the co-creation phase of INEDIT is the creation of
a first initial model that can be exploitable fro the in the open
manufacturing process. In that way, the model is received taking into
account the specific requirements of the customer, and the required
inputs to determine if the technologies available in the demonstrated
have the capacity to produce the product. In the case that it cannot be
produced, it is necessary to notify immediately together with the
arguments why it cannot be produced and offer ways of improvement.
