INTRODUCTION {#introduction .INEDIT-Headline1}
============

This deliverable deals with the description and implementation test of
the 3D printing of recycled plastic demonstrator. The ambition of this
use case is to test the feasibility of the distributed recycling via
additive manufacturing (DRAM) \[\@CruzSanchez2020\] concept with the
purpose to integrate in the Do-It-Together approach. There are two main
goals:

-   Evaluate the technical and logistical feasibility of the distributed
    recycling approach for the furniture sector, highlighting the
    advantages and barriers found in the implementation process.

-   Provide a explain the a methodology in order

The document is structured in three main parts:

Plastic Issues for the EU {#plastic-issues-for-the-eu .INEDIT-Headline1}
=========================

Since 1950', our society have gained enormous advantages in terms of
quality of life thanks to the technical development of the development
of plastic and polymer materials. Plastic is a material that is widely
used in our daily lives and plays a fundamental role in industry and
economic development. The plastic material are found in almost all our
products: food packaging, cars, technological tools, clothing, among
others. The main reason is that plastic materials offer a variety of
chemical and mechanical properties to be useful for a wide array of
applications. Plastics are extremely useful, but their mismanagement has
affected the environment and our health. The over-consumption and
especially bad practices (single use, difficulty of reuse, etc.), make
plastics one of the major societal challenges of an ecological
transition that has become imperative. The main problem is the
end-of-life treatment which traditionally uses a centralized system
where plastic waste often has to travel thousands of kilometers\... to
be incinerated or landfilled. In addition to the energy and
environmental impact of their production, there is also the impact of
the end of life.

Rethinking the development and use of plastics is central to the
circular economy paradigm, to provide less harmful options for the
environment. Thus, more types of plastic packaging are available, but
each reflects diverse circular economy strategies

Unfortunately, the plastic waste pollution poses a major threat because
of the issue of non-degradability affecting the ecological environments
\[\@Ryberg2019; \@Hopewell2009; \@Thompson2009b\]. Indeed, recycling
rates remain small (approx. 14%) in the plastic packaging field on a
global scale \[\@Hahladakis2018\]. Even in Europe, which tends to lead
on environmental stewardship, the recycling rate is about 32.5 wt%
\[\@Plastics2019\]. However, these values consider the amount of plastic
waste collected, rather than the total amount in circulation
\[\@Kranzinger2018\]. To tackle this accumulation waste problem, the
European strategy for plastics in the circular economy (CE) is gaining
attention in the policy and business debate surrounding sustainable
development of industrial production \[\@EC2018; \@Geissdoerfer2017\].
CE tackles a central societal issue concerning the current principle
\"take, make, dispose\" (linear economy) and its negative effects caused
by the depletion of natural resources, waste generation, biodiversity
loss, pollution (water, air, soil) and non-sustainable economics
\[\@VanBuren2016\]. The validation (technical, economic, legislative) of
waste plastic as a secondary raw material in industrial processes is
considered now a core target to integrate CE into the plastic value
chain \[\@Simon2019\]. Strategies of open and closed-loop recycling as
well as upcycling and downcycling functionality approaches can offer
paths to validate the secondary raw materials \[\@Zhuo2014\]. The
promotion of cross-sectorial valorization of plastic wastes through
Industrial symbiosis approaches seems to be a relevant strategy for the
circular economy strategies of the EU \[@﻿Karaylan2021\]

Plastics in the Furniture Sector

Description and Context of the Use Case  {#description-and-context-of-the-use-case .INEDIT-Headline1}
========================================

Presentation of the scale of the demostrator: Rives de Meurthe district (Nancy, France) {#presentation-of-the-scale-of-the-demostrator-rives-de-meurthe-district-nancy-france .INEDIT-Headline2}
=======================================================================================

![](media/image3.png){width="3.623999343832021in" height="3.185in"}

The demonstrator is placed at the City of Nancy - France, a city in
northeastern France, is the capital of the Meurthe-et-Moselle
department, on the Meurthe River in Lorraine. It is the industrial
center of a region rich in minerals (iron, coal, salt) and industries
such as metallurgy, foundries, metal construction and steel mills. Local
manufacturing includes chemicals, garments, printed fabrics and food
products. Nancy was the capital of the steel industry until its
collapse. In 1977, it created France\'s third largest technology park,
Nancy-Brabois, which is very accessible thanks to the highway network.

The creation of plastic recycling network will take place in the Rives
de Meurthe district. The Neighbourhood is the ***Rives de Meurthe***,
also called Stanislas-Meurthe or Les Deux Rives, is an administrative
district of the city of Nancy.

Located in the east of the city, the Rives de Meurthe district extends
from the banks of the Meurthe in the east to the boulevard Lobau and the
boulevard of the 26th infantry regiment in the west. To the south, it is
bounded by the rue de Tomblaine and to the north by the rue du Crosne.
Quite vast, it is separated from the rest of the city of Nancy by the
canal from the Marne to the Rhine. It thus gives the impression of being
an independent city, adjacent to Nancy.

The district is composed of two sections:

1.  Rives de Meurthe - Nord: close to Malzéville, having a rather
    industrial aspect with its locks, there are the large mills of
    Nancy. This area does not have any attractive places for the moment,
    but housing is under construction.

2.  Rives de Meurthe - Austrasie: the real center of the district, this
    part is located between the Meurthe to the east and the Marne au
    Rhin canal to the west. This area is home to the new 2 Rives
    shopping center, the district town hall, two schools of engineers
    (EEIGM -- materials, ENSGSI -- innovation), and the School of
    Architecture of Nancy (ENSAN) ~~(including~~ ~~INPL,~~ tourist
    hotels, and a number of entertainment centers such as the Kinepolis
    cinema complex (18 screens) and L'Autre Canal (the regional center
    for contemporary music with over 1,500 seats).

The choice of the Rives de Meurthe district is due to its proximity to
the Lorraine Fab Living Lab^®^ (LF2L) platform and its dynamics. Indeed,
initiatives have already been taken in this area in the logic of
recycling and short circuits, in particular the local mask recycling
network that brings together local actors.

The Third place Octroi Nancy {#the-third-place-octroi-nancy .INEDIT-Headline2}
============================

The third place Octroi Nancy is a part of the neighborhood of the Rives
de Meurthe. This project transforms the former slaughterhouses of the
city of Nancy into "cultural, creative and citizen" third place with
4600 m² of renovated buildings. ~~According to the strategical
planification of the Nancy city \[\@ref\], this neighborhood aims to
give~~ This third place is an open ecosystem that will bring together
artists, researchers and creative people with the public, the city\'s
inhabitants and businesses. Four large buildings that can be seen in
figure 1 (Figure 1) will offer a friendly and multidisciplinary living
space between culture and innovation, open to experimentation, to
develop a creative laboratory.

Lorraine Fab Living Lab^®^ (LF2L)  {#lorraine-fab-living-lab-lf2l .INEDIT-Headline2}
==================================

The Lorraine Fab Living Lab platforms is [[Lorraine Smart Cities Living
Lab]{.underline}](http://www.openlivinglabs.eu/livinglab/lorraine-smart-cities-living-lab)
is an interdisciplinary initiative, with an open governance, involving
several laboratories and other public and private partners as detailed
in Fig XXX.

This project has as a central mission to support the design, the
implementation and the evaluation of new processes for co-designing
smart and sustainable territories and businesses. It is hosted by the
Université de Lorraine and the main purpose is to establish a
"user-driven" based development model to enhance the citizen quality of
life and to support the local economic and urban development
\[\@Dupont2015\].

There are three key types of impact: (1) Industrial, (2) urban and (3)
new ventures creation

The [[Lorraine Fab Living Lab]{.underline}](http://lf2l.fr/) (LF2L)
(figures 1 and 2) is a research platform for prospective assessment of
innovative usages \[\@Dupont2016\]. The conceptual innovation framework
of LF2L takes into consideration the 2D (concept), 3D (object), 4D (over
time) approaches involving different type of stakeholders (e.g.
researches, companies, networks,) in order to have a foresight usage
evaluation of a new concept, technology or project. This approach is
useful to accelerate the deployment of industrial or urban
demonstrators.

The LF2L physical environment is constituted by a collaborative and a
FabLab[^1] space. The collaborative space allows users to foster
co-operation in engineering design with different stakeholders in order
to new create concepts/designs. On the other hand, FabLab space allows
users to materialize the concepts/designs in an easy and quick way in
order to have an prospective evaluation \[Boujut2003; \@Dupont2014;
\@Dupont2015b\]. The synergy of these two spaces enables the project
development in a living lab approach taking into account the *User
Centered Design* principles.

The conceptual framework is composed of three main elements as
illustrated in figure 2.2b:

> 1\. **Co-creation:** Creative process to find alternative resolution
> concepts to a problem-topic given integrating the key stakeholders in
> the process.
>
> 2\. **Prototyping:** Materialization (virtual/real) of the concept in
> order to have a first and quick in- sight.
>
> 3\. **Evaluation:** Establishment of the pertinence of the concepts in
> order to create a feedback/improvement process.

Different stages and 2D/3D/4D resources allowing prospective assessment
of innovative usages in order to support this conceptual framework
inside this "innovation space" as indicated in figure 2.3
\[\@Dupont2015b; \@Dupont2016\]:

Fabrication laboratories ("Fab Labs") are a global network of local
labs, enabling invention by providing access to tools for digital
fabrication. In that sense, Fab labs are a particularly relevant form of
the shared machine shop, specifying a minimal inventory of devices and
machine tools necessary to implement the founding idea of "how to make
(almost) everything" in any one lab \[\@Troxler2016;
\@Gershenfeld2005\]. The first Fab Lab was installed in 2002 at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); today there is a network of
more than 2000 active workshops according to the fablab network
(https://www.fablabs.io/labs/map) throughout the world. In 2007, an
international Fab Lab charter[^2] was adopted, establishing the
essential principles of the Fab Lab form---e.g., public access to tools
and knowledge.

3D Printing of recycled plastic demonstrator: the "Green FabLab"  {#d-printing-of-recycled-plastic-demonstrator-the-green-fablab .INEDIT-Headline1}
=================================================================

Rationale for the technological system of the 3D printing recycling demonstrator {#rationale-for-the-technological-system-of-the-3d-printing-recycling-demonstrator .INEDIT-Headline2}
================================================================================

Based on the context characteristics of the Lorraine Fab Living Lab^®^
and the Octroi local ecosystems, the 3D printed demonstrator also called
locally as the "Green Fablab", it is an initial demonstrator of the
distributed recycling approach that combines a living lab approach
inside a citizen third place ecosystem.

The Green FabLab demonstrator aims to experiment the technical
feasibility evaluation of a distributed and local plastic recycling for
3D printing technology in the context of these open innovation spaces
such as FabLabs, Hackerspaces or even industrial prototyping zones. In
these geographically distributed spaces, the polymer recycling process
of the surrounding areas (streets, neighborhood, industrial zones) will
be carried out at small lot sizes minimizing, energy consumptions, and
carbon emissions compared to the tradition centralized systems, as some
researches have already explored this path.

The main purpose of this demonstrator in the INEDIT project is to
understand the conditions under which to deploy a notion of circular
economy with the feedstock of the OS 3D printers. The outputs are, not
only by minimizing use of the environment as a sink for residuals but --
perhaps more importantly -- by minimizing the use of virgin materials.
Hence, the environmental impact of this technology is significantly
reduced. Moreover, taking into account the exponential growth of these
spaces (Fablab, Hakerspace, Makespace), they could help to increase the
efficiency to the problem of polymer recycling through the development
of a distributed recycling approach.

**The Green FabLab (GFL) project aims to demonstrate that plastic waste
material can have several uses, and therefore several values, during its
life cycle.** The same material could be recycled and transformed into
new raw material for different products. It is in this spirit that many
associations, SMEs, local authorities and individuals are developing new
local recycling practices that could allow us to aim for an economy that
is more respectful of the environment, fairer for society and more
engaging for local politicians

The Additive manufacturing (AM) -also known as 3D printing- is an
important industrial vector in the and its direct (and distributed)
manufacturing capabilities is becoming a key industrial process that
could play a relevant role in the transition from a linear to circular
economy \[\@Despeisse2016\]. AM technologies is expected to transform
the production process \[\@Rahman2018; \@Chen2017; \@Jiang2017\] thanks
to its ability to transform a numerical model into a deposition of
material (points, lines or areas) to create a 3D part \[\@Bourell2017\].
The expiration of the first patents has contributed to an increased
interest, creating consumer value and potential for disruption
\[\@Beltagui2020; \@West2016a\]. In economic terms, the global additive
manufacturing market is expected to reach USD 23.33 billion by 2026
\[\@ReportsAndData2019\]. However, determining when and how to take
advantage of the benefits is a challenge for traditional means of
production. From a societal viewpoint, \@Jiang2017 reported that the
product development could change from traditional stage-gate models to
iterative, agile processes changing the scenario by 2030.

The technical development of INEDIT's demonstrator is based on the
distributed recycling via additive manufacturing (DRAM) approach
\[\@CruzSanchez2020\]. This approach is a major scientific output from
the INEDIT project as a proposition of the future industrial landscape.

DRAM is defined as the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical
recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. In the literature,
DRAM approach emphasizes the technical steps required to reuse plastic
waste through the recycling chains for material-extrusion-based 3D
printing \[\@CruzSanchez2020; \@Little2020\]. The use of recycled
material, either in the form of raw material or blended with virgin
material, is a method of special interest to contribute to sustainable
manufacturing \[\@Zhao2018\].

Figure XX illustrates the conceptual model of DRAM.

In a general overview, the **Recovery (I)** phase concerns the logistic
operations to consider to collect the plastic wastes to be reused in
DRAM. The **Preparation (II)** phase corresponds to the actions and
strategies to identify, separate, sort, size reduce and clean waste
plastic to guarantee adequate quality for DRAM. The **Compounding
(III)** phase refers to the development of mono- and
composite-materials. The **Feedstock (IV)** phase identifies the actions
to fabricate the material usable for the printing process, either
filament for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) or the particle size for
Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF). The **Printing (V)** stage identifies
applications and process improvements for the recycled printed part. The
**Quality (VI)** phase identifies the multi-level technical
characterization performed to the recycled material.

In the DRAM methodology, consumers have an economic incentive to
recycle. This is because they can use their waste as feedstock for a
wide range of consumer products that can be produced for a fraction of
the conventional cost of the equivalent products. Moreover, 3D printing
is especially well suited because it enables the production of parts
with (almost) no waste, and could reduce the waste related to the
material by more than 40 %, reusing 95 % of the unused material
\[\@Petrovic2011\]. Currently, most of the cost of 3D printing is
associated with filament \[\@Wittbrodt2013\]. By recycling raw materials
such as Polylactic acid (PLA), one of the most frequently used materials
in 3D printing, it is possible to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions
that are incurred by transport to landfills or shipping to customers,
offering environmental benefits \[\@Santander2020\].

A large number of products can already be manufactured with AM, which
affects the geographical spread and density of global value chains
\[\@Laplume2016\]. It is expected that the reach of AM printable
products will be much greater in the future, as the production of
multi-material and built-in functionalities (e.g. electronics) will be
possible to a large extent. In addition, the production of spare parts
can be carried out on-site, modifying the role of suppliers in the
production lines \[\@Zanoni2019\]. \@Matt2015 explored the stages of
distributed model factories and decentralized production types ranging
from distributed capabilities to cloud production. Thus, the need of
transport will be much more carefully because the fact that AM will
enable decentralization of production to localities near customers or in
the most extreme distributed scenario at the customer\'s premises
\[\@Petersen2017a; \@BonninRoca2019; \@Wittbrodt2013\]. Moreover, AM
technology makes it possible to reduce market entry barriers, reduce
capital requirements and achieve an efficient minimum scale of
production to promote distributed, flexible forms of production
\[\@Despeisse2016\].

This enables an alternative option from an economy-of-scale to an
economy-of-scope, where the products are highly personalized satisfying
niche communities or even individuals \[\@Petrick2014; \@Hienerth2014\].
For these reasons, the AM technology could be a driver for a shift in
manufacturing from globally distributed production to local facilities.
Significant efforts are being made by industry and the scientific
community to move AM techniques from rapid prototyping and tooling
stages towards direct digital manufacturing (DDM) \[\@Mueller2012;
\@Holmstrom2016\], with the concomitant environmental and social
benefits. Nevertheless, \@Niaki2019 demonstrated that environmental and
social benefits are not the key preferential factors in the adoption of
AM technologies in different industrial sectors. Only the economic
factor remains relevant in the AM implementation, considering time- and
cost-saving as the most important reasons.

The implementation of the INEDIT Use case on the distribute recycling
approach needs to be done considering certain assumptions and
simplifications to reduce the complexity of this socio-technical system.
The context described in the next sentences in terms of geographical
scale, and the following considerations are considered.

*In this section, a description of the technical perspective of the

global chain for recycling detailing each stage aspect. *

Technical characterization of the 3D printing of recycled demonstrator {#technical-characterization-of-the-3d-printing-of-recycled-demonstrator .INEDIT-Headline2}
======================================================================

Recovery I {#recovery-i .INEDIT-Headline3}
==========

The first step in the implementation of the use case demonstrator is the
activity of **Recovery I** (figure XX). This phase aims to establish a
minimal baseline logistic operations to consider to collect the plastic
wastes to be recycled in the process. In the scientific literature, the
recovery is one of the main activities to considered in the recycling
process![](media/image13.png){width="6.58125in"
height="1.7472222222222222in"} given that this structures a supply chain
that certainly is variable (i.e. in fuction of the public supoprt to
sort the material in the specific points of collection).

The collection and recycling process aims to generate a recycling
micro-network at the local level (neighborhood scale), which allows the
recovery and revaluation of plastic waste through 3D printing. This
allows to save impacts related to the traditional treatment of plastic
waste, as well as to increase the recycling capacity in the city, giving
more independence over the recycling process. Figure XX illustrates the
process model considered.

*Figure XX presents the functions linked to the DIT Process are involved
in the Recovery aspect of the 3D printing recycling demonstrator:*

![](media/image14.jpeg){width="6.6930555555555555in"

In the framework of the INEDIT project, the UL case demonstrator
developed a "smart collector prototype". The complete documentation of
the technical device can be found in the following open access reference
\[\@gabriel2023\]. Also, given the impact, the source files are shared
in open-source repository[^3] with the purpose that open communities can
take advantage the experiences developed at the Université de Lorraine,
and eventually propose improvements and better versions. This is a
relevant strategy given the cross-line of Industry 4.0 and circular
economy, which is opening up fields such as smart waste management
systems options to improve the effectiveness of different materials,
including plastic waste \[\@Ranjbari2021\] using information technology
tools with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) \[\@fatimah2020,
\@rejeb2022\]. Smart waste management system (SWMS) consists of public
garbage collectors with embedded technology that is used to monitor
real-time level of garbage bins in public places \[\@Bano2020\]. The
interest of this system is to optimize the path for the garbage
collecting van that eventually reduces fuel cost. However, this work is
mainly based on simulation. Therefore, there is an avenue to simplify
experimentation in this domain using common open-source technology
(hardware and software) \[\@Pearce2009\] to implement projects that
require heavy infrastructure such as routers and a gateway to deploy in
the territory.

The main functional requirement of the smart collector is to collect and
provide data about plastic waste production in order to design a local
and distributed recycling chain of value. However, the smart collector
may be used in various use cases such as:

-   Monitoring the quantity of any other product that is collected over
    a large area.

-   Generating data about behavior to more precisely dimensions public
    infrastructure.

-   Monitoring the transformation and recycling process inside the
    transformation unit to follow the state and quantity of raw material
    and final product.

-   Initiating a digitization process in the waste management process as
    the information system element present here is flexible and commonly
    used in various types of projects.

It means the device will use a controller compatible with batteries and
use WAN technology to avoid the deployment of routers for data
acquisition. Although using various types of sensors allows us to
achieve better results \[\@Catania2014\] by crossing data, the main
indicator remains the weight.

The process described in the figure XX can be described in the as
follows:

1)  **Smart Collector installation:** The first step is to identify the
    main actors in the neighborhood through meetings, visits and
    interviews in order to propose integration into the recycling
    network by installing a smart collector on their premises.

2)  **Supervision**: The monitoring is done through a dashboard that
    provides direct information sent by the smart collector. This allows
    to know the weight of each installed smart collector, allowing to
    have an approximation of its degree of occupancy.

3)  **Receiving and storing plastic waste:** *The storage area must be
    organized and functional with respect to the needs of the
    demonstrator.*

4)  **Plan and execute the collection: **

Preparation II  {#preparation-ii .INEDIT-Headline3}
===============

The second phase of the corresponds to the actions and processes to
identify, separate, sort, size reduce and clean waste plastic to
guarantee with the purpose to obtain feedstock material that is adequate
for the distributed recycling process.

![](media/image17.png){width="3.45625in" height="1.7229166666666667in"}

The plastic waste preperation process aims to conditioned the collected
plastic to the requirements of 3D printing. For this process 3 main
sub-processes are considered:

-   **Identification and Sorting:** These two processes aim to identify
    the type of plastic given the regular standard for the polymer
    industry. The process of identification and separation of plastics
    is done manually and allows to separate the plastics that can be
    used as raw material for further production processes.

-   **Cleaning:** This process is aims to remove the traces of any other
    substance that may be present in the plastic waste. In this way the
    processing machines will not be exposed to possible anomalies linked
    to material impurities.

-   **Size reduction:** The size reduction process is carried out to
    possible obtain an adequate granulometry. This process allows to
    adapt the plastic waste for the direct injection process and the
    extrusion process.

-   **Drying phase:** This step prevents the formation of bubbles in the
    recycled material when it is melted during the following extrusion
    or densification step. Moreover, complete elimination of water
    prevent hydrolytic decomposition of the molecular chains during the
    melting or plasticization, so that the treated material has to be as
    dry as possible. In addition, some polymers, especially biopolymers,
    present stickiness at high temperatures and therefore, it is
    necessary to work with low temperatures, increasing the drying time
    \[\@Niaounakis2013\]. Common equipment used for the drying step are
    dehumidifier, oven, oven with vacuum, natural, centrifuge and
    fluidized bed with hot air. The maximal temperature employed was
    120°C and the maximal time utilized was 48h. As the literature
    review on end of life of plastic materials, the mechanical recycling
    is the most suitable way to reduce plastic wastes that will go to
    landfilling and to close their loop. However, the processing and
    service life cause thermo-mechanical degradation which may be
    responsible of chain scission and a deterioration of the mechanical
    properties and long-term stability \[\@Vilaplana2007\]. That is why,
    it is necessary the quality of material processing in the plastic
    recycling process to satisfy the requirements of the manufacturers
    and consumers of the final products \[\@Vilaplana2007\].

Compounding III  {#compounding-iii .INEDIT-Headline3}
================

The Compounding phase is related to the operation, strategies in the
development of composite materials using recycled feedtock intended to
be use in a printing process. There have been several literature reviews
about the technical aspect of composite materials in the additive
manufacturing context \[\@Singh2017, \@Hofstatter2017, \@Brenken2017,
\@Mohan2017\].

Special attention has been paid on material extrusion technologies in
the production of polymer/composite feedstocks as it is economical,
environmentally advantageous and adaptable to flexible filament material
\[\@Singh2017\]. For example, \@Mohan2017 presented a review on
composite materials and process parameters optimisation for the fused
deposition modelling (FDM) process for improving the mechanical
properties (i.e. tensile strength, fatigue). \@Brenken2017 reported a
detailed summary of mechanical properties of printed parts for different
composite material for fused filament fabrication. Five majors
strategies are elucidated from the literature review such as:

In the context of the Green Fablab demonstrator of INEDIT project, the
focus is to study the 1) mono-recycled material and 2) the
virgin-recycled blend material. The development of recycling niches of
mono-material where the additive manufacturing can be implemented is key
to study. Different studies in laboratory conditions have been made to
show the technical feasibility of recycling. They include HDPE
\[\@Anderson2017, \@Kreiger2013, Baechler2013\], Biomass-derived
poly(ethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PEF) \[\@Kucherov2017\], PLA
\[\@CruzSanchez2017\], Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE)/ low
density polyethylene (LDPE), \[\@Hart2018\], thermoplastic elastomer
(TPE) \[\@Woern2017\]. In fact, \@Hart2018 demonstrated the
reconstitution of residual polymeric packaging waste from
*Meals-Ready-to-Eat* (MREs) generated by soldiers around the world into
additively manufactured appliances. One conclusion of these studies is
the positive technical use of recycled mono-material for additive
manufacturing purposes. However, it has to be highlithed that one major
assumption of these studies relies in that the material used is already
sorted, cleaned and using a same type of discarded product. For INEDIT
project, the interest is to take into account the inner variability that
could be in the recovery process, concerning the type of material given
the fact, while there are seven types of recycling symbols for each type
of polymer, one major constraint in the current systems is that each
manufacturing company have a patented use of the additive in the polymer
matrix, in order to fulfil its initial function of the product.

height="3.3465277777777778in"}

Feedstock IV {#feedstock-iv .INEDIT-Headline3}
============

The *Feedstock III* phase refers to the processes in order to transform
the plastic waste into usable material for the fabrication stage. Two
outputs are seen in this etape: 1) the filament feedstock and 2) the
pellet feedstock. The use of filament or pellet material are in
coherence with the machine process used in the fabrication (cf section
4.4.5). The figure XX presents the modeling of the process:

![](media/image13.png){width="6.597916666666666in"
height="1.773611111111111in"}

The filament and pellet production process makes it possible to produce
the necessary raw material from plastic waste. The production of these
intermediate products allows the use of different technologies related.
Before using these products (filaments and pellets) it is necessary to
carry out evaluation tests to assess the geometrical characteristics
that are necessary in the printing process. In the prosumer domain,
there have been a models to create open source versions of extruder in
order to create plastic filament: Lyman Filament Extruder
\[\@Lyman2014\], the Filabot \[\@McN2012\], Recyclebot
\[\@Baechler2013\], RepRap Recycle Add-on \[\@Braanker2010\], Precious
plastic \[\@Hakkens2016\]. \@Woern2018a published a waste plastic
extruder capable of making commercial quality 3-D printing filament. The
filament production is made using a semi-open source commercial desktop
extruder. Figure XX and table present the technical characteristics of
the material equipement

![](media/image20.jpeg){width="6.6930555555555555in"

Fabrication process -- Technological mix to valorize the recycled material {#fabrication-process-technological-mix-to-valorize-the-recycled-material .INEDIT-Headline3}
==========================================================================

In this step, the major output is the valorisation of the plastic waste
material using different two alternative paths 1) desktop injection and
2) 3D printing process. As matter of the validation of the demonstrator
at TRL 6 level, the ambition of the Green Fablab demonstrator in the
INEDIT project is to experiment and prove a technological ecosystem mix
that seeks to valorise in a distributed approach different plastics for
different purposes and stakeholders. Therefore, the initial choice is
these two paths to create objects injected and 3D printed parts that are
useful to the local ecosystem of the demonstrator. The technologies are
presented in the following paragraphs.

Desktop injection moulding  {#desktop-injection-moulding .INEDIT-Headline4}
===========================

Injectin mouding is one of the most used technique to form plastic
materials.

The major point in the 'Green Fablab' case is to propose a maual
recycled aspecg to possible reutse the plastic waste

3D printing process: Fused Filament & Granular Fabrication (FFF & FGF) {#d-printing-process-fused-filament-granular-fabrication-fff-fgf .INEDIT-Headline4}
======================================================================

In the era of the additive manufacturing technology, without a doubt,
the material extrusion-based systems such as the fused filament
fabrication (FFF) has been one of the prominent processes. In fact, the
technological development of open-source 3D printers is creating more
affordable Additive Manufacturing (AM) machines for society in different
applications. It provides the possibility of mass diffusion of this
technology, and consequently, AM is being recognised as a disruptive
that could up-end the last two centuries of approaches to design and
manufacturing with profound geopolitical, economic, social, demographic,
environmental and security implications \\parencite{Pearce2014d,
Birtchnell2013a, Garrido2010, Campbell2011, Rifkin,Economist2012}.

Several studies in the literature validate the interest of this
technology from the materials, process and applications perspectives.
Different studies show that these technologies given the low energy
level for manufacturing, represented the technologies the most used in
the industry for prototyping, functional prototyping and eventually
final part fabrication.

In the Green Fablab demonstrator, we have two types of material-based
systems: 1) Fused filament fabrication (FFF) and 2) Fused Granular
Fabrication (FGF):

  ***Technical table of gigabot***   ***Photo Gigabot***
  ---------------------------------- ---------------------

The Fused Filament Fabrication was invented and patented in 1989 by
Scott Crump and since 2009 the technology became open source
\[\@Crump1992\]. This process usually uses thermoplastic polymer
filaments that are heated until a temperature slightly higher than the
melting temperature at the nozzle of the machine, reaching a semi-liquid
state. At this point, the polymer is extruded on the platform to create
the first layer of the object and after that, the polymer continues to
be printed on top of the previous layer, so that, filament fuses with
the previous layer and then is solidified at room temperature after
printing \[\@Ngo2018, \@CruzSanchez2017\]. In Figure XXX a schematic
representation of this technology is presented.

On the other hand, the Fused Granular Fabrication is a direct extrusion
systems of pellets is a key technical advancement to facilitate the use
of recycled material in the printing process. \@Volpato2015 describes
the development of a piston driven extrusion head that can extrude
polypropylene granules into a filament. The head was designed to
minimize the volume of material fused during the extrusion process and
reduce the effect of material degradation. \@Canessa2017 developed a
mini extruder for pellets or granules of recycled plastic that can be
used in a RepRap FDM 3D printer for rapid prototyping. The use of
Moineau pump technology to add precise volumetric control to the
extrusion of pellets opens extraordinary new possibilities. It is
important to mention that a Moineau pump has to be coupled to a first
stage Auger screw. This ensures a continuous feed of melted plastic
with-out inclusion of air bubbles, since the Moineau pump itself
cannotguarantee such condition. However, it is also important to
highlight that currently this technology is the phase of laboratory
experimentation and initial market diffusion. The complexity

at the carry out more extrusion tests with different sizes of pellets
ranging from large granules to plastic powder, and search for the
optimal 3D printing configuration parameters.

Then, once all the present Moineau-based pumps will become fully
operative, a real estimation of their performances in terms of relative
flow rate \$Q\$, speed (rpm), head \$H\$ and power \$P\$ needs to be
clarified.

The selection of material will depend on the type of material collected
and the needs determined for the production. Now 3 types of recycled
plastics are considered. PLA, PET for 3D printing, while PHDE is
considered exclusively for direct injection moulding.

  **STEP 2 - VALIDATION OF THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS OF MODEL TO FABRICATE**                 Furniture producers or FabLab with the support of 3D printing technical experts evaluate the printability (if the part can be printed with the available technology) as well as validate the design.                                                                                                                                            **7\_2**

  **STEP 3 - IDENTIFY LOCAL SOURCES OF PLASTIC WASTE**                                          This step starts identifying local sources of plastic waste at least 2 km far from the production site. Designers and technicians will evaluate the quantity and quality of possible plastic wastes that could be used as secondary raw material.                                                                                               **9\_2**

  **STEP 4 -- PUT IN PLACE SMART COLLECTOR**                                                    By using the Smart Collector developed by UL in the local areas (\< 2 km) it is enabled to collect plastic waste from the sources identified before.                                                                                                                                                                                            **9\_6**

  **STEP 5 - TRANSPORT WASTE MATERIAL TO THE RECYCLING FACILITIES**                             All the recycled plastic waste is collected and transported to the recycling facilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         **9\_9**

  **STEP 6 - ADEQUATION AND PREPARATION OF THE MATERIAL, MATERIAL PRINTABILITY VERIFICATION**   The collected material has to be adequate in order to be utilised as recycled feedstock (sorting of usable material, cleaning, etc). The treated material needs to be tested and validated (evaluation on usage and printability).                                                                                                              **10\_4**

  **STEP 7 - PATH PLANNING--3D PRINTING**                                                       Path planning software generates the best printing strategy to reduce the material used and time. The high-tech solution developed by UL manufactures using at least 30% of recycled plastic the product in the previously chosen manufacturing centre.                                                                                         **5\_1\_2**

  **STEP 8 -- POST PROCESSING**                                                                 If needed, a post-processing phase refines the product in terms of aesthetic quality in order to meet customer requirements. Some parts need to be assembled in the manufacturing site before shipping to the customer.                                                                                                                         **5\_1\_2**

  **STEP 9 -- TEST BY USE**                                                                     The DIT innovation space enables the designer to test the just realized prototype, to ensure proper functioning in real conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                             **6\_1\_1**

  **STEP 10 -- RE-DESIGN AND AFFINATION OF FABRICATION**                                        If the test by use of the prototype fails, the failure is improved and corrected, repeating the process (re-involving the necessary stakeholders and the technologies used).                                                                                                                                                                    **5\_2\_2**

  **STEP 11 -- VALIDATION**                                                                     The use case ends validating the product printed, first by the manufacturer and the designer, second by a responsible entity for verification of design feasibility that provides safety and environmental certification and lastly by the customer use (feedback).                                                                             **6\_1\_2**

Step 1 -- Receive Design and Specification {#step-1-receive-design-and-specification .INEDIT-Headline2}
==========================================

The first step in the reception of the design models and specifications
from the INEDIT platform.

The starting point of this activity is the reception of the 3D model
that needs to be produced. One of the outputs of the co-creation phase
of INEDIT is the creation of a first initial model that can be
exploitable fro the in the open manufacturing process. In that sent, the
model is received taking into account the specific requirements of the
customer, and the required inputs to determine if the technologies
available in the demonstrated have the capacity to produce the product.
In the case that it cannot be produced, it is necessary to notify
immediately together with the arguments why it cannot be produced and
offer ways of improvement.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
  ***Table of the documents that we received from the Inedit Plateform***   ***Photo of the plateform***
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------

Step 2 -- Validation of the technical specifications of model to fabricate {#step-2-validation-of-the-technical-specifications-of-model-to-fabricate .INEDIT-Headline2}
==========================================================================

The second step is the validation of the technical specification
considering three main criteria: 1) type of material, 2) dimensions and
tolerance technical requirements and 3) printability of the proposed
piece. ![](media/image25.png){width="3.8513888888888888in"
height="1.9645833333333333in"}From the validation of these 3 criteria,
it is established whether the print is of the expected quality and meets
the demanded requirements. In the event that the product does not
conform to the specifications, a problem evaluation is carried out.

**Problem Assessment:** *The problem assessment process allows to
generate a report identifying the main causes that prevented to obtain
the desired product. This may be related to the 3D model received, in
which modifications should be proposed to improve the result. *

Step 3 -- Identify local source of plastic waste {#step-3-identify-local-source-of-plastic-waste .INEDIT-Headline2}
================================================

One of the most complex tasks in this use case is the generation of a
closed-loop supply network approach for the distributed manufacturing
\[\@Santander2020\]. The task of the identification of local source of
plastic is fundamental as the first stage in the recovery process.

The collection tasks consists of collecting plastic waste at different
previously established points, which is then transported to a treatment
center where it is recycled.

The main difficult relies in the pertinent identification and\
The methodological approach consists of the following steps:
Pre-diagnosis of the territorial context, Identification of the actors,
Analysis of the actors\' involvement.

\[\@Santander2021\] evaluated the benefits of a near loop and closed
loop recycling network focused on additive manufacturing, mainly
producing recycled filament. The main results show an economic and
environmental benefit of sourcing filament from recycled plastic rather
than purchasing exported virgin filament.

The methodological approach consists of the following steps:
Pre-diagnosis of the territorial context, Identification of the actors,
Analysis of the actors\' involvement.

The 3D printing process considers the entire printing process. This
activity considers the reception of the document from the platform, the
parameters of the printer used (Gigabot XL) and the choice of the
material, which are predecessor and necessary steps for the printing
stage. After the product has been printed, an evaluation of the printing
is carried out to determine whether the product is of good or bad
quality, with the objective of validating the printing for subsequent
shipment. If not, a report is made with the problems found to determine
the main ways of improvement.

![](media/image26.png){width="6.6930555555555555in"
height="1.0694444444444444in"}After an identification step of local
stakeholder in the Rives de Meurthe neighbourhood, we deployed a
smartcollector oriented to collect bottle caps with the capacity to
mesure the weight inside in real time and showed in a dashboard. So,
this system allow us to optimize the collection phase.

Once the smart collector is produced and deployed the technical process
is showed in the figure 2. The processus star with the installation of
the smartcollector and the system activation to begin the collection
gate. Once the smartcollector is online, it is necessary to survey the
online dashboard to control the waste plastic quantity inside of the
smartcollector. When in the dashboard is showed a weight more than 3 kg,
we assume that the smartcollector is almost full and we start the
collection. The distance of the collection place is less than 2km so is
carried on by bicycle or on foot to avoid the possible impact produced
for a combustion or electric vehicle. When the waste plastic is
collected, it is stored.

-   **Consumption and performance:** In terms of consumption the
    smartcollector is connected to the power supply of 5v 24 hours a
    day. For the moment we have 8 smartcollector deployed.

Concerning the pre-diagnosis of the territorial context, it allows to
better understand the characteristics of the territory in relation to
the project. It is an essential step in order to have knowledge of the
mechanisms, actors and resources that can be mobilized. To reach this
objective two methods are necessary: Documentary research (existing
studies, documents of territorial planning and development such as the
Atlas (Scalen)), Exchange with key actors of territorial development and
sustainability issues (Association ATP, Echogeste, Agence Scalen\...).
Then, all the collected data are gathered in an Excel table while
separating between strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats.
Also, between the nature of the data, namely: political, economic,
environmental, social, technological and cognitive and finally
territorial planning. (Annex: 1).

| -   Data collection via semi-structured interview guides              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

With regard to the identification of actors, at this stage, it is
necessary to draw up a map of actual and potential actors. To do this,
we must first identify the role of each actor, then the sources of
plastic waste collection, and then identify the sources of 3D printing
and potential synergies with LF2L. In order to achieve these results, an
exchange with key actors in territorial development is necessary.

The analysis of stakeholder involvement is based on identifying the
motivations, needs and constraints of stakeholders in relation to the
plastic collection and recycling process, with stakeholders identified
as potential sources of collection. These data are collected via
semi-structured interview guides, developed in the form of a field
survey questionnaire, as shown in the graph below:

![](media/image27.png){width="7.040342300962379in"
height="3.4055555555555554in"}

***Figure 7: Interview guide on stakeholder involvement***

On the other hand, it is a question of getting feedback from the key
actors of the territory on the recycling network who are not necessarily
a source of collection (ATP association, Rives de Meurthe, Echogeste,
\...), but who can intervene in the process of creating the recycling
network (materials, local, \...). For this purpose, another interview
guide was prepared consisting of eight questions about the issues of the
Rives de Meurthe district, the actions carried out on the territory in
relation to plastic recycling, and how the investigated organization
participates in recycling.

Step 5: Transport waste material to the recycling facilities {#step-5-transport-waste-material-to-the-recycling-facilities .INEDIT-Headline2}
============================================================

Recovery where the waste plastic is collected and transported to Green
Fablab facilities where the preparation the waste plastic ready to use.
After these threes stage we arrive at Production phase, where the raw
materials are transformed in finish or semi-finished product. In the
last stage we found the transport phase where thank to a local
logistical circuit we send the product to the client or stakeholders.

Step 6: Adequation and preparation of the material {#step-6-adequation-and-preparation-of-the-material .INEDIT-Headline2}
==================================================

This is the first stage carried out inside the green fablab. This stage
is the set of activities required for the plastic waste to be adapted
for further use. The Green FabLab works mainly with 4 types of plastics.
The most common are high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene
(PP), which are the main plastics used in the production of bottle caps
and are collected in the smartcollector. The plastic waste from bad 3D
printing is made of polylactic acid (PLA) and lastly plastic bottles are
made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). HDPE and PP are mainly used in
the plastic injection molding process, while PLA and PET (Mixed with 9%
HDPE) are used in 3D printing.

![](media/image26.png){width="6.625694444444444in"
height="1.1034722222222222in"}In this stage we can find 3 main
activities (see figure below).

Commonly, the sorting step implies high costs that limits the
implementation of a recycling process that requires this step, so that,
virgin materials are usually less expensive than the corresponding
collected and sorted postconsumer plastic waste \[\@Niaounakis2013\].
Note that by encouraging consumers to sort their recycled waste by
providing a direct economic incentive to fabricate their own products
short circuits the vast majority of technical sorting steps. This short
circuit would function for both individual-, as well as community-based
recycling. In the case of Green Fablab demonstrator, this process is
made manually given that the collection process is locally.

In the cleaning step the material passes through a (manual or
industrial) washing system where dirt and adhesives residues are
removed. Some studies found in the literature review used aqueous
solutions of NaOH for 10-30 min and with temperatures varying from 60°C
to 90°C. The bibliographic research shows that it exists a tendency to
use this NaOH solutions. In the distributed case conventional manual
cleaning would be adequate for sterilizing the plastic waste.

Finally, the phase of the size reduction looks to obtain plastic waste
where the granulometry correspond to the extrusion / printing. The
plastic waste need to be in reduced from a range of between 25-50 mm in
the shredding process to 3-5mm approximately after grinding. In
addition, conventional grinding equipment such a knife mills generate
heat when large parts of polymeric materials are processed, which can
melt or soften materials that have a melting temperature or a glass
transition temperature relatively low \[\@Niaounakis2013\]. Many open
source granulators are already available on Appropedia, Precious
Plastic, Open Source Ecology (OSE) and others. Precious Plastic has
commercialized both a kit and fully made OS plastic grinder product.

  ***Technical table ***   ***Photo Reitcher***
  ------------------------ ----------------------

-   **Sorting:** The preparation process begins with the separation and
    identification of each plastic collected. As already mentioned, the
    plastics used in the Green FabLab are 4 (HDPE, PP, PET and PLA) and
    are separated by type of plastic and colour. This process is carried
    out manually.

-   **Cleaning:** Because plastics are mainly household waste, they are
    not in an adequate state of cleanliness. This is why cleaning is one
    of the key phases, because the control of the material in processes
    such as 3D printing is controlled. This process is differentiated
    depending on the type of plastic used and its purpose.

    -   For plastic injection moulding, where mainly PP and HDPE are
        used, the plastic is washed in a sink with hot water.

        -   **Consumption and performance**: The water consumption per
            gram is approximately 4L/1000g. The drying of the plastic is
            done in the open air without using any specific technology.

    -   For additive manufacturing, where mainly PLA, HDPE and PET
        blends are used, the cleaning process is much more controlled.
        The process is carried out in a small ultrasonic cleaning
        machine, to ensure that impurities are removed. To remove all
        the moisture from the plastic it is necessary to carry out a
        drying process in a conventional oven.

        -   **Consumption and performance:** la cleaner ultrasonic
            permite lavar 200gr de plástico en un litro de agua, en
            términos energéticos la duración del proceso es 20min con un
            consumo de 2kWh. En el secado, el plástico es puesto en el
            horno a 60°C durante 15h teniendo un consumo de 0,061 Kwh.

-   **Shredding:** The last process in the preparation of the raw
    material is the size reduction of the plastic waste. For direct
    additive manufacturing the optimum size for printing is between 3
    and 5mm, so after shredding it is necessary to sieve. In terms of
    plastic injection moulding, the plastic flakes can be slightly
    larger than those required for 3D printing.

    -   **Consumption and performance:** The shredder has a speed from
        700 rpm up to 3000 rpm. Normally we use a rotational speed of
        1500 which produces an energy consumption of 0.7 kWh. The
        process takes 15 minutes per kilogram of material with a loss of
        approximately 10%.

Filament is produced at 0.4 kg/h using 0.24 kWh/kg with a diameter
±4.6\\%. 3Devo

pellets is necessary when you have 3D printers that use this form of
material. To carry out this process it is necessary to go through an
extrusion phase to produce filament. From there, using an open-source
Pelletizer[^4], it is possible to cut the filament into small pieces,
producing the pellets.

**Production **

In the Green Fab Lab, we have focused on two ways to carry out
mechanical recycling of plastic waste. In this way we can separate our
production process into two main technologies.

**Additive Manufacturing**

![](media/image26.png){width="6.04375in"
height="0.6284722222222222in"}The first technology is additive
manufacturing (3D printing) and is defined as \"a process of joining
materials to make parts from 3D model data, usually layer upon layer, as
opposed to subtractive manufacturing and formative manufacturing
methodologies\". At GFL we are developing techniques related to fused
filament fabrication (FFF) where the raw material fed into the machine
is in the form of filament and is the most popular technique in material
extrusion. and fused granular fabrication (FGF) which is characterised
by the use of plastic pellets or plastic flakes.

To carry out this first activity we need to have an important adaptation
of the raw material, especially if we want to use the FFF technology
that prioritises the use of filament. For this process we use a filament
extruder machine called 3Devo[^5], This machine has an automatic speed
control to improve filament diameter and allows us to have a good
control of different parameters such as temperature, winding speed, fan
speed, among others. Allowing to obtain a good quality and a good
consistency of filaments.

-   **Consumption and performance:** To make one kilogram of recycled
    filament, 4 hours of operation are necessary with the indicated
    parameters. Its energy consumption is relatively low at 0.15 kWh.

For the second FGF technique, the adaptation process occurs in the
shredding activity corresponding to the raw material preparation process
(2). The adaptation corresponds to the use of a specific grid that
allows the plastic to be shredded to obtain a size between 3mm and 5mm,
which is the ideal size in terms of granulometry for 3D printing.

![](media/image26.png){width="6.492361111111111in"
height="1.4201388888888888in"}After carrying out this adaptation of the
raw material it is possible to start with the 3D printing process, for
which it is necessary to consider different parameters. In our case the
Gigabot XL is a FGF machine, i.e. as mentioned, it is designed to use
plastic pellets or plastic flakes.

The following parameters are used to obtain an optimal print on recycled
plastic on the Gigabot, it does not mean by any means that these
parameters have the same effect on another machine, because it strongly
depends on the set of components that the printer has and the type of
plastic that is being used.

This explained, the parameters used are: When we have

**Injection Moulding**

The second technology is the injection moulding and is defined as "the
shaping of rubber or plastic articles by injecting heated material into
a mould". The process begins with the definition of the object to be
produced. Then it is necessary to establish what types of parts are
needed to produce the object. We have 2 pre-established parts which are
considered as standard and can be easily adapted to different types of
products.
